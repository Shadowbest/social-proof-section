## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a fun challenge, a bit more complicated than I anticipated. Aligning the stars on desktop was somewhat complicted to achieve. I also learned more about accesibility and semantic HTML. I also learned that you can use more than one background image on an element and use other background properties for each one.


### Continued development

I'm still not quite sure how to position many background images, their size and position to better reflect the design. So I will have to keep studying to better comprehend them. And I still will keep reading on accessibility.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Kevin Powell's youtube channel helped me on this one. I remembered once I saw him use different background images and could control the size and position of each one separately.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website is very good for quick references on many HTML & CSS techniques.
